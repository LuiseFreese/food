- 100 g soft Medjool dates
- 140 g gluten-free rolled oats
- 2 g baking soda
- 4 g baking powder
- 2 g cinnamon
- 50 g walnuts (chopped)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the oat flour: Blend the gluten-free rolled oats into a fine flour using a blender or food processor
2. Prepare the date paste: Blend the pitted Medjool dates with 2–3 tablespoons of warm water until smooth. Set aside.
3. Preheat the oven: Heat your oven to 180°C
4. Mash the bananas: In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas until smooth
5. Mix wet ingredients: Add the eggs, Greek yogurt, olive oil, and prepared date paste to the mashed bananas. Mix well
6. Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the oat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon
7. Combine wet and dry: Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until fully combined. Be careful not to overmix
8. Add walnuts: Gently fold in the chopped walnuts
9. Bake: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45–55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean
10. Cool: Let the banana bread cool in the pan for 10–15 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely
